# Data Cleaning and Analysis Project

## Overview

This project aims to conduct data cleaning and analysis tasks using Python. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies/data)). Key tasks include identifying missing data, converting and removing decimals, extracting year from date columns, removing duplicates, analyzing the relationship between budget and gross revenue, identifying correlations between different movie features, and providing numeric values to object data types for correlation analysis with gross revenue.

## Key Features

1. **Identifying Missing Data**: Detecting and handling missing data in the dataset.
2. **Converting and Removing Decimals**: Processing columns like budget, gross, and votes to remove decimals and convert them to appropriate data types.
3. **Extracting Year from Date Columns**: Extracting the year from the 'released' column to facilitate temporal analysis.
4. **Removing Duplicates**: Eliminating duplicate records from the dataset.
5. **Analyzing Relationship between Budget and Gross Revenue**: Visualizing and analyzing the relationship between budget and gross revenue using scatter plots and regression plots.
6. **Identifying Correlations between Movie Features**: Utilizing a heatmap to determine correlations between different movie features, particularly with gross revenue.
7. **Providing Numeric Values to Object Data Types**: Encoding object data types with numeric values to facilitate correlation analysis with gross revenue.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.).
3. Run the provided Python scripts to perform data cleaning and analysis tasks.
4. Review the generated visualizations and insights obtained from the analysis.

# COVID Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves exploratory analysis of global COVID-19 data using SQL. The objective is to derive critical insights into various factors such as death rates, infection rates, vaccination rates, and regional trends. The analysis provides insights into the impact of the pandemic on different geographical locations.

## Key Insights

1. **Possibility of Death in India**: Analysis of mortality rates in India.
2. **Percentage of Population Infected**: Estimation of the percentage of population infected by the virus in India.
3. **Highest Infection Rate by Population**: Identification of regions with the highest infection rates per capita.
4. **Countries with Highest Death Count by Population**: Ranking countries based on death count per capita.
5. **Death Count by Continent**: Categorizing death counts by continent.
6. **Global Numbers**: Tracking global statistics such as new cases and deaths.
7. **Vaccination Rates**: Assessing the number of people vaccinated relative to the population in different locations.

## Usage

1. Access the provided SQL database containing COVID-19 data.
2. Run SQL queries to extract relevant data for analysis.
3. Analyze the retrieved data to derive insights and trends.
4. Visualize the findings using appropriate charts or graphs.
5. Document the insights obtained and share the analysis report.
