# Data Cleaning and Analysis Project

## Overview

This project aims to conduct data cleaning and analysis tasks using Python. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies/data)). Key tasks include identifying missing data, converting and removing decimals, extracting year from date columns, removing duplicates, analyzing the relationship between budget and gross revenue, identifying correlations between different movie features, and providing numeric values to object data types for correlation analysis with gross revenue.

## Key Features

1. **Identifying Missing Data**: Detecting and handling missing data in the dataset.
2. **Converting and Removing Decimals**: Processing columns like budget, gross, and votes to remove decimals and convert them to appropriate data types.
3. **Extracting Year from Date Columns**: Extracting the year from the 'released' column to facilitate temporal analysis.
4. **Removing Duplicates**: Eliminating duplicate records from the dataset.
5. **Analyzing Relationship between Budget and Gross Revenue**: Visualizing and analyzing the relationship between budget and gross revenue using scatter plots and regression plots.
6. **Identifying Correlations between Movie Features**: Utilizing a heatmap to determine correlations between different movie features, particularly with gross revenue.
7. **Providing Numeric Values to Object Data Types**: Encoding object data types with numeric values to facilitate correlation analysis with gross revenue.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.).
3. Run the provided Python scripts to perform data cleaning and analysis tasks.
4. Review the generated visualizations and insights obtained from the analysis.
